# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes and visualizes customer churn data for a telecom company. The goal is to explore various aspects of customer demographics, offers, contract types, payment methods, and service usage to identify factors contributing to customer churn.

## Problem Statement
The analysis focuses on the following questions:
1. **Churn Rate**: What is the churn rate for the given dataset? A pie or donut chart visualizes the percentage of customers who have churned versus those who have stayed.
2. **Age and Gender Distribution**: How are the age and gender of the customers distributed in the dataset?
3. **Customer Tenure Distribution**: What is the distribution of customer tenure? A histogram highlights churned customers with a different color.
4. **Popular Contract Type**: What is the most popular contract type among the customers? A bar chart highlights churned customers with a different color.
5. **Payment Method Distribution**: What is the distribution of customers across different payment methods?
6. **Relationship Between Total Charges and Tenure**: Is there a relationship between total charges and customer tenure? A scatter plot highlights churned customers with a different color.
7. **Total Revenue Distribution**: What is the distribution of total revenue among the customers in the dataset?
